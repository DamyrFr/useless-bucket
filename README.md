# Useless bucket

Everyone knows what is a [useless box](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Useless_machine) !

But we are at the cloud age, and we need an cloud version of the useless box. So I have create this project, to build this.

## Workflow

This projet will implement a S3 bucket who will trigger at object upload an AWS Lambda function. This function will remove the uploaded object.

## Technical part 

I use Terraform and Python for the AWS Lambda function. Just deploy and enjoy.
